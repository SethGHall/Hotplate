We are looking for someone to share our cool Mt Albert pad. Ideally we are looking for someone respectful, tidy, friendly and around a similar age to us 
(late twenties to late thirties).  We are busy working during the week so looking for someone who is chilled out and not a party person.

We are a relaxed couple in a 2 bedroom renovated 1940s cottage, we also have a cute and friendly cat. 
The house is very bright and sunny with a north facing deck. 
We also have a new heat pump, alarm and unlimited fibre internet.

Room is 3.6m x 3m with a small built in wardrobe and comes with furnishings if required (drawers, bedside drawers, lamp and a comfy queen bed). 
Our place is walking distance to bus and train services and a 20min walk to Unitec. 

Rent is $220 per week PLUS $30 expenses for water, power and internet. Bond of 2 weeks rent required. 

Room is available from now, but we are happy to wait for the right person. We are preferably looking for short to medium term flatmates.
 
If interested please reply back with some information about yourself and to arrange a viewing.

No smokers, No Pets.
